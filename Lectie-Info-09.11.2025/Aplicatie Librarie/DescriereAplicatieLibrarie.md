**Library**

Thaddeus is the librarian of the “1BookADay” Library. He needs a software application to help him manage his library's books. Each Book has the following attributes: title, author, date of publishing, publisher and quantity. Thaddeus wants the application to help him in the following ways:

- (a) Add, delete or update a book. A book is uniquely identified by its title and author. If a product book already exists is added, its quantity will be updated (the new quantity is added to the existing one).
- (b) See all available books containing a given string (if the string is empty, all the available books will be considered), sorted ascending by book name.
- (c) See only those books that are in short supply (quantity less than X items, where the value of X is user-provided).
