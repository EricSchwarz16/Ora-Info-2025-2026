""" 1)
sort() in Python function is very similar to sorted() but unlike sorted it returns nothing and
makes changes to the original sequence. Moreover, sort() in Python is a method of list class and
can only be used with lists.

Syntax: List_name.sort(key, reverse=False)

sorted() method sorts the given sequence as well as set and dictionary(which is not a sequence)
either in ascending order or in descending order(does Unicode comparison for string char by char)
and always returns a sorted list. This method doesn't affect the original sequence.

Syntax: sorted(iterable, key, reverse=False)
