**Pharmacy**

John is the administrator of the “Smiles” Pharmacy. He needs a software application to help him manage his pharmacy's medicine stocks. Each Medicine has the following attributes: name, concentration, quantity and price. John wants the application to help him in the following ways:

- (a) Add, delete or update a medicine. A medicine is uniquely identified by its name and concentration. If a product that already exists is added, its quantity will be updated (the new quantity is added to the existing one).
- (b) See all available medicines containing a given string (if the string is empty, all the available medicines will be considered), sorted ascending by medicine name.
- (c) See only those medicines that are in short supply (quantity less than X items, where the value of X is user-provided).
- (d) Provide multiple undo and redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation performed by the user. - if this is too complicated you can leave it and we will cover it in the next lesson - hint: use the stack data structure -> you can try solving this problem(https://www.pbinfo.ro/probleme/4807/librarie) it does not matter the language you solve it in(cpp/python or whatever) it is just to help you with the idea of this task (if you submit in cpp you can also see how many points you get on your solution:D)
